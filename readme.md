## The DVC guide is here 

1) git init -- to initialize the git repository

2) dvc init -- to initialize the dvc repository  

3) 

DVC is only used to track the data files not the code
    -- rather than adding the entire code to the git it is always a good idea to add the reference file to the data that will be data.dvc file to git 

.dvc/config -- will contain all the information about remote repositories where the data needs to be added.
